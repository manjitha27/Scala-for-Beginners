The name Scala stands for “scalable language.” The language is so named because it was designed to grow with the demand sofits users. 
You can apply Scala to a wide range of programming tasks, from writing small scripts to building large systems. Scala is easy to get into. 
It run sonthe standard Java plat form and it in teroperates seamlessly with all Java libraries. It’s a great language for writing scripts that 
pull together Java components. But it can play out its strengths even more for building large systems and frame works of reusable components.
Technically, Scala is a blend of object-oriented and functional programming concepts in a statically typed language. The fusion of 
object-oriented and functional programming shows up in many different aspects of Scala; it is probably more pervasive than in anyother widely
used language. The two programming styles have complementary strengths when it comes to scalability. Scala’s functional programming constructs
make it easy to build interesting things quickly from simple parts. Its object-oriented constructs make it easy to structure larger systems 
and to adapt them to new demands. The combination of both styles in Scala makes it possibleto express new kinds of programming patterns
and component abstractions. It also leads to a legible and concise programming style. Because it is so malleable,programming in Scala can
be a lot of fun.
